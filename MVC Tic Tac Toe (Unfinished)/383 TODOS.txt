TODO LIST:

        // log out code axios.get('api/users/logout', {})

-- Do Soon----
Register User 
--------------

-- Do Now---------------------------------------------------------
In app.js we have a react router command that wraps the login

What I need to do is implement a setAppUserState

I need to put in an axios get in order to the user.

So basically figure out how to implement all of the things added
to app.js into the code for Login. :Y

------------------------------------------------------------------


--Just added------------------------------------------------------

We have added a constructor for user in the app.js file
as well as a constructorDidMount and a setAppUserState 
which interacts with the ReactRouting for login on the main page. 

------------------------------------------------------------------


--the users in the app.js constructor-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So as far as I know, I am setting the basic user in app.js, In login i am going to have to assign it, then when Component
mounts I get the user (with axios get?) and then the app user is set, which then changes the react router. So do all that
and things will be Good.
